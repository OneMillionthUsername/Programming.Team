## Many thing are implicitly respectful

As a contributor to the existing project, given unspecified style
property I guess from the original author's mention. This is to be
less intrusive and coherent as a contributor, introducing new code.

## C# version(in style) preferred to be kept it classic

It is preferably `C# 9` or older. It's guessed after the conversation
about using `file-scoped namespaces`. The latest is `C# 13`(2025).

List of big features in `C# 10` to `C# 13` (to avoid otherwise noted):
- `global using`(10)
- `file-scoped namespaces`(10)
- Attributes on lambdas(10)
- Parameterless struct constructors and field initializers(10)
- `record struct`(10)
- `with`(10)
- new update in interpolated strings(10)
- Mix declarations(10)
- new update in Lambda(10)
- `CallerArgumentExpression`(10)
- raw string literals(11)
- generic math operations(11)
- utf-8 string literals(11)
- pattern macthing on `span<char>`(11)
- list patterns(11)
- `required`(11)
- auto default struct(11)
- primary constructor(12)
- collection expressions(12)
- default lambda parameters(12)
- `using` as any type(12)
- `Experimental` Attribute(12)
- Interceptors(12)
- `extension`(13)

## Format: pretty much default C# style

Guessed following:
- New lines for braces in Methods
- New lines for braces in Accessors
- New lines for braces in AnonymousMethods
- New lines for braces in AnonymousTypes
- New lines for braces in ControlBlocks
- New lines for braces in LambdaExpressionBody
- New lines for braces in ObjectCollectionArrayInitializers
- New lines for braces in Properties
- New lines for braces in Types
